Hello there! Iâ€™m **Maia**, and this is my first README markdown with **MacDown**.

**Circumference.py** is a program I created to compute the value of pi when given a radius of a circle. 

**areaCode.py** is a program I created to begin using Regular Expressions to find key phrases within a text database. You may find a link here [RegEx](https://regex101.com).

**gene_names.py** is a program I created to combine RegEx principles with formatting variations such as JSON, comma, or tab delimited when extracting data from a file into a formatted output.
